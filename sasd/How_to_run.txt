1. Download the file 
2. Open terminal

Packages to install:
   
If you only want to use the parser install the library using pip and you’re good to go:
#pip3 install beacontools

If you want to perfom beacon scanning there are a few more requirements. 
#First of all, you need a supported OS: currently that’s Linux with BlueZ, and FreeBSD. 
#Second, you need raw socket access (via Linux capabilities, or by running as root).

On a typical Linux installation, it would look like this:
# install libbluetooth headers and libpcap2 sudo apt-get install python3-dev libbluetooth-dev libcap2-bin 
# grant the python executable permission to access raw socket data sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' "$(readlink -f "$(which python3)")" 
# install beacontools with scanning support pip3 install beacontools[scan]
